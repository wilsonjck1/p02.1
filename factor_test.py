"""
Problem:

    The function factor_test takes in two numbers, a and b.
    If a and b are the same - print "a = b"
    If a is a factor of b - print "a is a factor of b"
    If b is a factor of a - print "b is a factor of a"
    Otherwise, print "No factors here"

Tests:

    >>> factor_test(10, 5)
    b is a factor of a
    >>> factor_test(23, 23)
    a = b
    >>> factor_test(9, 11)
    No factors here
    >>> factor_test(7, 28)
    a is a factor of b
