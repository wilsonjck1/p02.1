Problem:

    Many non-trolls stereotypically assume that trolls are illiterate
    and innumerate.

    This, like many stereotypes, is untrue.

    Trolls count like so:  one, two, many, lots ...

    Where "many" is any number between 3 and 8, and "lots" is any number
    bigger than 8. The troll_count function takes an integer in, and should
    print the appropriate troll equivalent.

Tests:
    >>> troll_count(1)
    one
    >>> troll_count(2)
    two
    >>> troll_count(3)
    many
    >>> troll_count(5)
    many
    >>> troll_count(8)
    many
    >>> troll_count(9)
    lots
    >>> troll_count(12)
    lots
